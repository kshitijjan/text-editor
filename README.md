## Issues/Challenges

During the development of this project, I encountered the following issues/challenges:

The biggest issue I faced is downloading the Qt Creator. There was some connection issue from the server side so it was downloading at the speed of ~200kbps, no matter how fast your internet is. And after downloading around 300 MB the downloading automatically fails. So I thought there is some issue with MacOS files. So I created a Virtual Machine and installed Ubuntu and Windows but still had the same issue with both operating systems as well. I downloaded this software around 20 times and faced the same error each time.
- How I resolved this issue?
I downloaded individual packages for the file which had created this issue.
- In Qt Creator, if you are building a project in CMake, if you add resources like PDFs and logos then you have to create a .qrc file. Also, the resources file is not directly added just like VS Code or any other IDE, you get a path of the added resources.qrc file and you have to manually add that path to CMakeLists.txt. This issue took around 2-3 hours to solve because this was my first time using Qt Creator.

- But I learnt a lot while building this project :)
